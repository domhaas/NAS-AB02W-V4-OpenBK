## OpenBK-Example-Config for "NEO Coolcam Temperature and Humidity 3in1 Alarm Siren (NAS-AB02W) Version 4"

I recently purchased this device and unfortunately realised that the device has the version number ‘4’.
This is not compatible with Tasmota, as there is no ESP chip installed.

However, I was able to successfully flash [OpenBK](https://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App). Unfortunately, version 4 has much less to offer in terms of built-in features: For example, there is no longer a temperature/humidity sensor and the volume of the siren can no longer be controlled (fixed value). In any case, I couldn't find any channels for this.
